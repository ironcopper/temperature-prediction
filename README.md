## Introduction

Our aims in this notebook are
* to find which variables are significant in predicting the mean temperature
* and how well do those variables describe the mean temperature.



## Dataset

This data set is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data).


## Learning Outcomes

* Using and showcasing techniques and libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn)
* Checking for missing data values in the dataset
* Outlier detection
* Identifying input feature and target variable
* Visualizing different variables to see their distributions
* Visualizing relationships between variables via correlation matrix
* Building and training the Linear Regression Model
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
* Using performance metrics to check the accuracy of the model (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2)
